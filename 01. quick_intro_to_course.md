# Aim :

Give you an under the hood view of NodeJS as well as make you familiar with what code to write and how to write. Really show you **inner working of NodeJS**.

First few videos will tell what exactly is NodeJS and how it works under the hood. And why it is more successful compared to other more traditional servers, for certain purposes.

Once we are done with conceptional videos then we move towards using modules, reading and writing of files, streaming and creating a server as well as routing.

At the end of first section of videos we will be **publishing our server to a remote VPS** (virtual private server) using Digital Ocean.

Second section focuses on **advance topics such as express framework and middleware** and more complex topics such as templating engines.
