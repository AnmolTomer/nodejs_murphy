# HTTP REQUEST AND RESPONSE

* We talk about the client (browsers) and servers communicate to each other via HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. We saw streaming or reading of text file from text file A to text file B, this goes on all the time on server side i.e. we were working in Node server and reading from readme.txt and writing to writeMe.txt file, all within the server environment.

* With the introduction of client or browser into the landscape, there's completely different change of pace which can also be CURL, which mimics a browser, client sends a request to our Node Server and then server will send this data across the network, across inter/intra-net and back to the client. Hence, this is a completely different paradigm.

* The way clients talk to servers is through something called request object, so user would initiate a request object on the browser say typing in your browser google.com would generate a request to the server for google, this request object has 2 distinct parts to it which are header and body, if we look at the header firstly then within header also there are 2 distinct sections, which can be called title of the header and this title of header has 3 distinct components. Typically it is like what's below 
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

  * The first of first one is request type these commonly are GET and POST. GET means getting something, asking the server and POST means sending something, hey Mr. Server it's your friendly neighborhood Anmol and I have some data for you is basically what POST is.

  * Second of first component is piece of header file is URL that client is requesting from server here we ask for /index.html.

  * The third of first component part of header is simply the protocol to be followed HTTP.

* The second component area header fields, this is an opportunity to tell the server much more about what is included in the request.

* Very important header field is host, the client must tell the server where it wants to go, so enables to uniquely identify a Web domain or the URL of server has to be put in the request otherwise the request will get lost on the internet. There are many other things as well which can be added or other header fields can be added too. To help client communicate and tell server what to expect.

### Body

Body section of a request, GET request is to ask for something from server and POST is to give server, if we POST data then that data is included in the BODY section of the REQ, if we include data in the body then other header field called content type needs to be added what this does is it will tell the server that in the req the client is asking for what type of content. When this request reaches the server then the server is an event emitter. What we can do is have this event emitter listen for request event, so as to listen for request and we will attach an event handler that the server will action upon receiving the request, which we'll see in next lecture.

Server receives the request and a part of the event handler the callback function will generate a response back to the client.

RESPONSE has a very similar format to the REQUEST object, again we have header and body ,header section has title, header fields in response we have only 2 components in header whereas there are 3 components as described above in REQ header.

HTTP1.1 200 OK  // Server saying ok I found your file, everything OK sending the file back in response, 200 is code for OK.

There could be some instances where server looks for file requested and file is not found then in that case the server will also have to communicate to the client that file requested was not found and will put a 404 and not a 200.

After header title we have header fields, there can be many of this as there are in request object, a very important header field which is used a lot is content type. In this case server needs to tell the client about the kind of data client will be receiving in the body of the RESPONSE.

We will communicate readMe.txt to our client and we need to tell client what kind of data is coming back in the body. text/html for html content in header field content type. To give the client idea about how to interpret the data received as response from server.
