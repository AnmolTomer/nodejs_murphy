# HOW NodeJS works ?

We will learn more about **V8 engine**. It **drives the google chrome browser by processing the JavaScript** and also works on server for NodeJS same V8 engine.

The core of V8 engine, is event loop. There is event queue which sends the event to event loop, event loop sends the request to thread pool, these can be things like database
calls and queries. Event loop takes the event sends to thread pool and tells it to send the response whenever it is done and moves on to taking another event from queue again.

Say you click detect my location using a button on browser, then it won't happen just with JS, it will do it using an API and passes this request from client to the backend or thread pool and then thread pool processes and finds the person's location and then JS tells the backend that when you have the location let me know by adding a new event to event queue. JS is basically looping around one event at a time. Say someone else needs pictures, then again we go at it with one at a time passing these requests and on 
browser these are passed through APIs like Google Maps, geolocation etc. But it is same on servers as well. Event can be a database call from client or anything else.

Remember, JS on the server won't be doing DB request it will pass this task separately to a thread and at a separately generated thread the DB request will be done.

When DB request comes back with information from the database, it will get passed at the bottom of the event queue. 

Say another request is network request to Twitter API, again JS passes it off as another thread.

This way we can handle lots of concurrent requests at the same time. Thread pool can take multiple requests at once and get through them extremely quickly.

Once that is done in thread pool then adds the response by communicating to the JS Event Queue which works on first in first out principle FIFO and tells it to take the next action.

This is why Node is extremely fast and is very useful using the V8 engine as it uses the logic of Event Loop of browser on the server.

Technical Jargons associated with Node :

- **Asychronous :** It just means that program can start on a new request before finishing the last one, that is processes multiple requests parallelly in a way, that is takes first
  request, takes second request even if first request hasn't finished processing.

- **Event Driven :** Again event driven means event queue is full of different events like get info from DB or info using Twitter API. JS V8 engine responds to these requests.

- **Non Blocking I/O :** JS thread is not being blocked when one of the multiple processes or events takes more time than other events being processed parallelly, and creates
  possibility for events which take time to execute without any problem. It just takes the event from event queue passes it to the thread pool and moves to taking next event,
  whenever the thread pool indicates that response is ready for the event which was given it adds it to event queue as output.

- **<u>How does thread pool communicates back to the event queue of JS ?</u>**
- **<u>How is JS reminded of the last pool say sometimes a long time passes when it comes back to event queue ? How does JS remembers ?</u>**

In JS you can pass functions inside the functions, so you can have a function which says go and bring some info from Twitter via API and attached to it you can pass another function and say to that original function that when you get the response data back from Twitter then please pass back this function that I am giving you. This is called callback function.

So what happens is when in the thread pool the twitter info is received then it adds to the JS event queue is not just the data that came back from twitter but the callback
function that is attached by JS to the original request. That is how JS is reminded of what is asked for.
