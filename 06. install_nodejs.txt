LTS is the long term stable and another choice is current version.

LTS is stable and more suitable for deployment or production ready, whereas if you want all the cool new features then go for current version.

Select your OS and installation file respectively.

Run the installer and accept all the default settings and be done with it in less than a minute.
Here we are installing on the local machine, when we want to use node on production then we install node to a server.
In upcoming videos we will learn how to install node on DigitalOcean.
We would be using local host for first few videos.
Type node -v in the powershell, if you get a response like v10.15.3 then you are good to go and installation has worked correctly.
Node allows us to use cmd or terminal as a sandbox for playing with our code. Node code is JS with extra functionality.
Node can be said as JS++ in a way.
Typing node in terminal starts the node.exe file which gets automatically added to path during installation.
Now we can type node code in the powershell itself.
E.g. of code which you can type and see for yourself : 

> var one = 1
undefined
> one
1
> var two = 2
undefined
> one+2
3
> one + two
3
> 2+one
3
> = Input and line below > means output

Node supports ES6, EcmaScript standards a few example of this are :

> var two = 2
undefined
> one+2
3
> one + two
3
> 2+one
3
> const two = 2;
SyntaxError: Identifier 'two' has already been declared
> const three = 3
undefined
> three
3
> two+three
5
> three = 92
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.


Another functionality that we can have a look at are arrow functions : 

> let add = (a,b) => {return a+b};
undefined
> console.log(add(2,3));
5
