This is a very fundamental course which starts from the scratch and gives you appreciable knowledge about nuts and bolts of Chrome's V8
engine which is at the heart of NodeJS, C++ extensions and we go on to talk about things like role of C++ extensions, single JS thread
which acts as event loop and passing on those to thread pool and do some cool stuff like calculating how much free memory RAM you have, 
or fetching info about your Processor, Cores and that's surely going to give you a hackerman feeling as a beginner.
