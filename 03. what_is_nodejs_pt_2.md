<u>**V8 is written in C++, a much lower level and powerful language then JS, which is flexible.**</u>

- NodeJS has V8 engine at its core, NodeJS takes the V8 engine out of the browser and puts it on the server and makes up the core of what NodeJS is. 

- V8 engine on the browser is great but it can't do things we need to do on the server such as making DB requests or making file requests etc.
  V8 engine is open source and is embedded into other C++ applications. So, we can build our own C++ application which embeds V8 engine.

- On top of V8 we can add C++ extensions to increase the JS functionality that we can use on V8 engine.

- When EcmaScript ES standards are changed then Google needs to change the V8 engine, specifically the C++ code used on V8 engine and extend the V8 engine to recognize these
  new standards. Essentially this leads to increase the JS vocabulary of V8 engine.

- Node translates the EcmaScript JS and embedding C++ extensions allows it to understand new JS.
- So not only it understands JS commands but also with help of extensions it can do stuff like doing server requests. This is what NodeJS is fantastic at.
- C++ is such a low level language and we allow JS to do what C++ does and this is what NodeJS is.

`The outermost layer of NodeJS is JS layer called core modules. Core Modules are written in JS. These are modules which allow us to write JS to access the extensions.`

```
V8 inner most layer, C++ extensions intermediate layer, core modules outermost layer in JS.
The above are 3 layers of Node and revolve around extending the V8 engine and modifying it so we can write JS to perform server logic rather than just browser logic.
