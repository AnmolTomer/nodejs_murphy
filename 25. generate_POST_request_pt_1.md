# 25 -Generating POST Request with AJAX Pt. 1

**Here we will learn about generating POST requests using AJAX and introducing concept of SPAs.**

- ## HTTP Request/Response Cycle

  Client sends the request object to server and server responds with response object.Both request and response objects have a header and body section. Now talking about previous notes where we used ejs.render() method to send back a page to our client.Say an event on client side, entering a particular URL of a type and hit RETURN key then technically it would be same as you had anchor tag or hyperlink to some address and you clicked it then that's the event being emitted. It was a get request so within the header there are 3 most common fields, within a HTTP header there are URL, method and content type URL had location of root **localhost:8080** and within it we used root parameters **/anmol** and query strings **?fname=Anmol&lname=Tomer ** to pass data from client to the server, we use this URL header field in the request object's header. Method was GET and Content-Type was nothing as there is no body of GET requests.This is the difference between GET and POST requests. POST requests have data in the body. Node Server received the request with some data delivered through URL via the parameters mentioned above then server used ejs <%= %> HTML file and merged in the data that was passed via URL using root parameter and query string. Then server almost dynamically based on data sent created the page and sent it back.

  Server sent the response back and Content-Type would have been text/html as response obviously does have body. Client received it and showed that to us. When we submit requests in this method then a full page refresh and a complete downloading of a fresh new page from server occurs every time new info is sent.

  In next notes we will changing the requests in three different ways. 

  1. via URl submitting data via URL we can do using GET request.
  2. Using a POST request in body.

  Submitting data via POST request is much more preferred as submitting data via URL can be seen by anyone.
  Another benefit is that we can send a lot more data compared to when we send data just by using URL. As we have access to body in POST request and we can submit a lot more data.

  Another big change is that event that is triggering request to the server, we will use AJAX here. We do not want to generate a full page refresh, we want to mimic something which is known as single page application. Single Page application basically means you download everything that client needs on the first download. It is not entirely true as we can do AJAX requests to pull back small pieces of data and we are not fully refreshing the data. Download the foundation of page on first request and then we never do full page refresh and we just ping the server for small bits of data and it keeps working. AJAX means Asynchronous JavaScript And XML Asynch is the part we are interested in as we do not want to send the request and then waiting for the response to come back for full page refresh. We want to send the event provided a callback function and when response is received we call back the function and then update the page section but full page refresh.

  Third difference is that logic to create the page is going to be  done on client side and not on server side.

  Previously using EJS, EJS dynamically created the page on the server and send the entire thing back to the client. This time our server will just send back a small piece of JSON data to client. Client is where JS logic resides to update the page.We are moving some work from server to client. Algorithm for how this works :

1. Request is made using AJAX
2. URL will just be http://localhost:8080
   1. There won't be any query strains on this url.the method will be post and Content-Type header field will be JSON when this gets to server we create a separate route because we have to route for GET request than POST request, server responds with userName and fullName with JSON again header will be json. JSON will come back to client it will run the JSON which is transmitted back and then update our page without a full page refresh.
