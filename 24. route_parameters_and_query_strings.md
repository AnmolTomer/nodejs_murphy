# 24 - Route Parameters & Query Strings



In last video we used render method for express. Render method on response object allows us to pass a JavaScript Object containing data to our index.ejs, which allowed us to create a dynamic page for user. We were able to change username dynamically in the last video. In current method we are hardcoding the username which isn't ideal for real life application, a much more way would be to tailor the view based on the information taken from the user. There are multiple ways to get data from user, we are using get request so get request do not have a body and they just have a header so all we have is URL string passed from the user and the request header, in future we would be seeing POST request, these have body and are able to pass in data through the body. With GET we just have URL and header.

Using the URL with node we can use it to pass the information quite effectively and there are 2 different methods which can be used to collect data from the user, that is passed in the URL, first of these methods is query parameters.

We can send data separated by / e.g. localhost:8080/some_name and based on some_name URL we can get a different view in response from server. To do this we change  first app.get to following  **/:id what :id represents** is that **anything after / of localhost:8080/**  is going to be represented by id, so whatever data is passed after / can be captured within our Express callback function. We console.log req.params.id. Whatever we enter after / gets captured by the URL parameter :id and then gets logged to console by req.params.id

```javascript
app.get(['/','/:id','/index.htm'], function(req,res) {
    console.log(req.params.id) // request object's parameters and id property this will read the id of :id and prints whatever is after /
    res.render('index.ejs',{userName:"Anmol Tomer"})
})

```

Now we know how to receive data using /:id now next comes is how to respond with a different view when user enters username after localhost:8080/ so we have to populate the username in top right and customise the page for the user based on the profile name which they enter after /. So we just change username:id with username:req.params.id.
Now after entering anything after / leads to username being changed to strings after /. This is how to get info in root parameter. That is one way of collecting data from user and customizing our view of front-end.

Second method is something called query strings, these are anything after the questionmark in the URL.

We will add 2 query parameters, first one being fname=Anmol&lname=Tomer. Instead of req.params.id which we used to collect the root parameter, we will do a request query. We cannot directly console.log this query, we have to do JSON.stringify() to capture the data as it returns a JS object. Data is what we pass after the question mark in query string. So now on passing what is below in URL what we would get is :

```bash
localhost:8080/anmolt?fname=Anmol&lname=Tomer
```

a JS object into the console.

```bash
anmolt
{"fname":"Anmol","lname":"Tomer"}
```

Now that we have captured first and last name, we can further use that to customize the view. What we will do is as we are right now we are only passing single **key:value** pair of username, we will **add a second key-value pair** and value is going to be **request.query** object as this object  and this **req.query** has more than one key:value pair inside it. As req.query is an object with 2 key:value pairs i.e. first and last name we can use both of these in our view.

Now, we customise the Hello Welcome to Bitcoin Chat Application message by editing ejs file. But here req.query passes us 2 key:value pairs and we would have to use dot notation to get specific values which are embedded.

Final JS Code changes in server.js which were crucial for #24 : 

```javascript
app.get(['/','/:id','/index.htm'], function(req,res) {
    console.log(req.params.id) // request object's parameters and id property this will read the id of :id and prints whatever is after /
    res.render('index.ejs',{userName:req.params.id, fullName:req.query})
    console.log(JSON.stringify(req.query)) // Gives us a JSON object in the JSON format
})
```
