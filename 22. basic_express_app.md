# Basic Express App

Last video we used NPM to download express from cloud and went into some depth of NPM, node modules, package.json and dependencies.

First we did npm init which created package.json and then we did npm install express --save to download express where we saw after downloading it gets added to package.json file as dependencies and installation of express creates node_modules directory and all the dependencies of express are present in this directory. Installing something like express to a folder which has npm initialised already registers it as that app's dependency.

After having express installed, we will convert server code in 22. server.js in regular node to or native node to serve our particular app. Old code will be in 19. server.js

Having a look at old app we have 19. server.js file which is server file and you have seen the path in #21. Refer again.

Comparing native node and EJS we see that :

### <u>**On native side:**</u>

* We needed fs and http, 2 core modules.

* We then created server using http module's createServer() method 

* We have following code to run on any request (one of the major differences between native and Express way of doing things)

```javascript
server.on('request',(req,res)=>{

    let url = req.url

    let myReadStream

    switch(url) // followed by case to write switch cases for every file.

})
```

* On the native side we are executing the same single method (&callback function) regardless of URL requested.

* We have to write following for http response, first we response with response code and content type.

  ```javascript
  res.writeHead(200,{'Content-Type' : 'text/html'})
  ```

  

* Creating readStream and specifying character encoding such as UTF-8 

  ```javascript
  myReadStream = fs.createReadStream('./public/19. index.htm','utf-8')
  ```

  is the next thing we do and then we move to readAndWriteFile() which has the code as follows

  ```javascript
  function readAndWriteFile() {
      myReadStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
          res.write(chunk);
      })
  
      myReadStream.on('end', () => {
          res.end()
          console.log("read stream finished writing to response object.")
      })
  }
  ```

  And this readAndWriteFile() function basically reads the data from read stream and then pipes it to response object, response event emitter which is a writeable stream and then we wait until the read stream has ended to communicate back the response that all the chunks have been read and sent and then we do res.end().
  
  
  
* Last piece of code was creation of server.listen(port,'IP')

  

  





### <u>On express side :</u>

* We only need express module

* On the express side we are saying const app = express(), here after express we use parentheses.

* When we require express what is exported is actually a function, to be able to use express we need to execute the function, which is needed from express module and what is returned from express() function is populated within the app of type const. this app = express() is equivalent of what was populated in the server var in 19. server.js

* We use the following code  when files are requested : 

  ```javascript
  app.get(['/','/index.htm'], function(req,res) {
      res.sendFile(__dirname+'/public/19. index.htm')
  })
  
  app.get('/contact.htm', function(req,res) {
      res.sendFile(__dirname+'/public/contact.htm')
  })
  
  app.get('/css/main.css', function(req,res) {
      res.sendFile(__dirname+'/public/css/main.css')
  })
  
  app.get('/js/main.js'), function(req,res){
      res.sendFile(__dirname+'/public/js/main.js')
  }	
  ```

* Here our app is an event emitter, with Express we are executing a separate method, with its own callback function for each separate URL requested. There are 4 types of request that can be done GET,POST,PUT and DELETE. On native side we did not address this and we just said that irrespective of the type of request we will run the code with switch cases based on URL submitted, if we wanted to use different GET, POST, PUT, DELTE then we would have to use request object to extract the type of request that is done, in the native code with switch cases all the requests being done are GET but we do not specify that, but in the case of using both GET and POST we would need to specify and hence making our native code with switch valid only for GET requests. We might need entire different set of switch or if statement to make native code comply with POST requests too, but express makes it easy and we can use 

  ```javascript
  app.get()
  app.put()
  app.post()
  app.delete()
  ```

* This is how ExpressJS handles it, by looking at the following line we know that it is for which URL and for which kind of request

  ```javascript
  app.get(['/','/index.htm'], function(req,res) {
      res.sendFile(__dirname+'/public/19. index.htm')
  })
  ```

* Native code runs switch case for any kind of request. Also, next thing we should focus on how we are serving the file back to the user, say index.html, how you have to define Content-Type in native code need not to be defined here as Express intuitively knows about Content-Type is because it simply looks at the extension of the file we are sending, and figures it out and status code like 200, 404 etc. is conveyed by Express within http response without us specifically mentioning it.

* Creating readStream(), readAndWriteFile() all of these things are taken care of by Express, all we do is we take our response object which as we can see above for app.get we have basically 2 parameters an array of URLs with which we want it to react to and then there is a callback function and this callback function passes in a request and response object.
  We have req,res being passed into callback function and all we have is one single line instead of long code we saw for native code, and that right there is beauty of Express achieved using one single method called sendFile(), and sendFile() takes care of reading, creating the read stream and reading from /public/index.html and creating the write stream and writing it to the response. Does all of this in one line of code.

* In Express we do app.listen(port,'IP') and instead of doing server.listen, app.listen and then running our console.log we have used a callback function, first parameter is port and second is URL/IP and again writing '127.0.0.1'  isn't really needed as Express is smart and it knows that we would be listening on localhost only, and our callback function tells where the server is running.
