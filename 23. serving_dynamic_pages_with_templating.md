# 23. Serving Dynamic Pages with Templating :tada::computer: 



In #22 we used sendFile method on the response object in Express to serve a very basic index.html file to our browser and we used the same express method to serve accompanying contact.htm, main.js and main.css file. Now we will be moving towards making a Bitcoin Chat Application over the course of next few notes. Apart from index.html all files are same for now in the chat app. It will be present inside the bitcoinChatApp directory. We still have same server.js and other files.



### Serving Dynamic Pages

We have talked about static files in past and static files go inside the public folder as static files can be viewed by public like main.css and main.js etc. in our case are all inside public folder, these files are called static because when these files are served in the browser these are not modified in any way like say there is index.html if you go to dev console and then view source and thus running the file from source code or within website would be same and nothing changes between the time file is read from server and written to stream. Completely unaltered.



Multiple times we would like to serve something dynamically, say modifying index.html based on weather or the time of day or the user who is requesting the html.

We want to modify index.html based on the user in this case. We would be changing username at the top-right so we want to dynamically serve this index.htm file based on which user has requested the file. 

Now the way we can embed data into the files we serve to the user and make files dynamic is through templating. Templating has many different apps but we would be using ejs which stands for Embedded JavaScript and we have to install this module from npm using

```bash
npm install ejs
```



After installing ejs we first need to tell our express app that we would like to use ejs as our templating engine or view engine.

We do this with the following syntax :

```javascript
app.set('view engine','ejs')
```

It tells the app which templating engine developer, i.e. you would prefer to use.

Now we would be replacing index.html with a dynamic ejs file, now firstly we need to create a views folder, and by default, it looks inside a folder called views, we take our index.html file from public folder and since we want this to be dynamic we would paste it inside the views folder and we would rename this to index.ejs.



On running node server with server.js as entry point then as 127.0.0.1:8080 will server root URL then in reality index.ejs file will be served, which is exactly the same as  index.html file we had.

We have not done anything dynamic yet. Say we want to change the username in the upper-right corner, the way we can add something dynamically is that we go to index.ejs file and we replace the placeholder Your Username here with some ejs code which will act as a placeholder and substitute here in ejs file.  

```ejs
<%= userName>
```

Now when express runs server.js and it sees 

```javascript
app.get(['/','/index.htm'], function(req,res) {
    res.render('index.ejs',{userName:"Anmol Tomer"})
})
```

then it sees there was a placeholder for some data to be inserted and by passing the second argument to res.render method where we are putting in a single key:value pair and key will be name of placeholder variable and value is what we want embedded for given key so username will be Anmol Tomer, in reality we would be pulling in the data for username key:value from a DB. Say MongoDB. Here we pretend as if a DB has served the key:value pair for testing purposes.

In the placeholder  in index.ejs value would be substituted from server.js file.



Restart the server refresh the tab and you would find dynamic updation of username in top right corner. :arrow_upper_right:
