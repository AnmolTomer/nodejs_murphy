# Express, NPM and package.json

In this lecture we will cover Express framework in node, then we move to NPM node package manager and lastly we will understand

package.json, which works alongside npm.

In the directory myFirstNodeApp on running node 19. server.js we are able to see very simple nodeApp that we built, and folder structure is

D:.

│   19. server.js

│   server.js

│

└───public

​    │   19. index.htm

​    │   contact.htm

​    │   index.htm

​    │

​    ├───css

​    │       main.css

​    │

​    └───js

​            main.js

After creation of node server if you see 19. server.js then you might see that switch(url) is used which has different cases based on URLs requested by the user and this responds in different ways.

For each of the file we write the Content-Type header, followed by creation of readStream and then we run the function readAndWriteFile(), what this function does is myReadStream listens to the data event and then it writes the chunk to write stream which is the response object and then we have on('end') event for readStream which then ends the response to the browser.

As we add more and more choices for the user then switch will get more and more complex and lots of code and this is really hectic to create readStream and writeStream when working on a grandiose level, what EJS really does is saves us from hectic code and simplifies and streamlines the code for us.

To get Express Framework we have to download it using NPM, npm is basically a market of fantastic node modules which is present in cloud and is like playstore for node. Check if npm is present by doing npm -v, if you get version number then you are good to go.

When we initialise the npm then package.json file is created in the folder. You'll understand benefits of package.json later on, for now just do it by typing npm init in the powershell, init stands for initialising.

Enter project name, github repo link (not compulsory) and other things then you will see package.json file is created.

Next, we move to installing express in the directory having entry point in our case 19. server.js. Install express by entering npm install express --save in the terminal. Now upon checking package.json you might see a new entry at the bottom which would be something like

```json
"dependencies": {

​    "express": "^4.17.0"

  }
```

Also, node_modules folder is created and other than express there are other modules present inside it as well, the reason other modules were installed because express has its own package.json and has its own set of dependencies which it needs to function perfectly.

This is the reason other modules were installed. So in a nutshell, Express has some dependencies and those dependencies has their own dependencies so npm installs all the inter-related dependencies.

Parent package.json tells the node or other developers that what all dependencies they need to install before running the program which uses node.

Say we delete node_modules folder and we were to publish our application to github and what we can do is instead of uplaoding bulky node_modules folder with tonnes of subfolders we can just upload package.json folder and user can just run npm install and what this command will do is look inside the package.json folder and on finding the listed dependencies it will install them.

**Go ahead try it yourself. :)**
